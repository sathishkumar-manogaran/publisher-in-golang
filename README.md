### Publisher in GoLang with RabbitMQ

**How it works?**

* Run RabbitMQ in local with default username and password
  `username: guest` `password: guest` `port: 5672`
    * We can change this value in `queue.go`
  
**Note:**
* This project support publisher alone.
* Use this linked project to consumer message [Consumer Project - GitHub](https://github.com/sathishkumar-manogaran/pub-sub-in-golang).
